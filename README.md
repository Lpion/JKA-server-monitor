# Server-monitor

This is a small server monitor made for Jedi Knight Academy and the clan i am in, but would work for any Quake3 engine based game. 

It displays the current players, bots, server plugin info, and map.

Main logic to fetch the data via UDP packages would be in the getServerInfos.php, while in the main.js the recieved data gets processed for output. 

Special thanks to [Miha](https://github.com/MihaMi27), who works on a similar project but written in Java and as desktop application, and supported me in my project.
